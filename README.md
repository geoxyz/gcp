# Deploying reverse geocoder lite VM on GCP

The reverse geocode lite is a very fast reverse geocoding API. It takes as input a Latitude, Longitude pair and outputs either XML (default) or JSON text with the name of the nearest major locality name, as well as the nearest location name and other regional information from both geonames.org and openstreetmap.org neighborhood/administrative area data.
